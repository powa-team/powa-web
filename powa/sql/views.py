    Base for query used in the grids displaying info about pgss.

    This is based on the "detailed" version of the table, with queryid
    information.

    As the data is stored in 2 sets of tables (the coalesced records and the
    "current" records), we have to retrieve the query in multiple steps.

    To improve performance, the retrieval of the coalesced records is divided
    in 3 parts, which can greatly limit the number of rows that will need to be
    sorted.

    Those 3 parts are split in 3 subqueries.  For the left and right bounds
    (the smallest and largest timestamp in the given interval), we get the 2
    underlying records in the coalesced records (if any) and unnest them
    fully, filtering any records outside of the interval bound.  For any record
    in the coalesced records that are entirely inside the given interval,
    we rely on the pre-computed metadata (mins_in_range and maxs_in_range) and
    simply return that, which can greatly reduces the amount of rows to sort.

    For the "current" records, we simply return all the rows in the given
    interval.
